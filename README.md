# Preact Flickity Component

This is an adaption of [@theolampert's](https://github.com/theolampert)[React Flickity Component] (https://github.com/theolampert/react-flickity-component) that is compatible to [Preact](preactjs.com).

It doesn't use PropTypes, Portals or any of that fancy React stuff.

I built it because I needed to mount a Flickity Slider, and I'm afraid that I will have to do it again at some point in my career.
